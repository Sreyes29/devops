# PetClinic Deployment

This directory contains all the files needed for automated deployment of the Spring PetClinic application.

## Deployment Process

The deployment process is fully automated through the Jenkins pipeline. The following steps are executed:

1. The application is built and tested
2. Static code analysis is performed
3. Security scanning is executed
4. The application and deployment files are packaged
5. The package is copied to the production VM
6. The `setup.sh` script is executed to:
   - Install Java (if needed)
   - Create the application user
   - Set up the application directory
   - Configure the systemd service
   - Start the application

## Manual Troubleshooting

If you need to manually troubleshoot the deployment:

```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status petclinic

# View application logs
sudo journalctl -u petclinic

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart petclinic
```

## Configuration

The application configuration is stored in `application.properties`. Edit this file to change database settings, logging configuration, or server properties.
