# PetClinic Ansible Deployment

## Deployment Process

The deployment process is fully automated through the Jenkins pipeline using Ansible. The following steps are executed:

1. Install Java if needed
2. Create the application user and group
3. Set up application directories
4. Deploy the application JAR file
5. Configure the application properties
6. Set up the systemd service
7. Start and enable the service

## Files

- `deploy-petclinic.yml`: Main Ansible playbook for deployment
- `petclinic.service.j2`: Template for systemd service
- `application.properties.j2`: Template for application configuration

## Manual Execution

If you need to run the deployment manually:

```bash
# From the ansible-deployment directory
ansible-playbook -i inventory deploy-petclinic.yml -v
```

## Customization

You can customize the deployment by modifying the variables at the top of the deploy-petclinic.yml playbook.
